            <p>I'm a hard working, ambitious and creative person who has spent his whole life working as a successful hospitality management professional. After many years in the business
              I wanted to take on a new challenge that required me to dig deep into my logical and problem-solving tool belt. Coding has become a natural outlet for me to project my 
              innovative talents as well as my conceptual capabilities. My goal is to find a web design firm willing to give me an opportunity to hone my new skills and allow me the leeway to 
              grow my developmental knowledge.</p>
